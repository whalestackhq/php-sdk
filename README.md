## Examples

**Create a Customer** (https://www.coinqvest.com/en/api-docs#post-customer)

Creates a customer object, which can be associated with checkouts, payments, and invoices. Checkouts associated with a customer generate more transaction details, help with your accounting, and can automatically create invoices for your customer and yourself.

```php
$response = $client->post('/customer', array('customer' => array(
    'email' => 'john@doe.com',
    'firstname' => 'John',
    'lastname' => 'Doe',
    'company' => 'ACME Inc.',
    'adr1' => '810 Beach St',
    'adr2' => 'Finance Department',
    'zip' => 'CA 94133',
    'city' => 'San Francisco',
    'countrycode' => 'US'
)));

if ($response->httpStatusCode == 200) {   
    $data = json_decode($response->responseBody, true);
    $customerId = $data['customerId']; // use this to associate a checkout with this customer
}
```

**Create a Hosted Checkout** (https://www.coinqvest.com/en/api-docs#post-checkout-hosted)

Hosted checkouts are the simplest form of getting paid using the COINQVEST platform. 

Using this endpoint, your server submits a set of parameters, such as the payment details including optional tax items, customer information, and settlement currency. Your server then receives a checkout URL in return, which is displayed back to your customer. 

Upon visiting the URL, your customer is presented with a checkout page hosted on COINQVEST servers. This page displays all the information the customer needs to complete payment.

```php
$response = $client->post('/checkout/hosted', array(
    'charge' => array(
        'customerId' => $customerId, // associates this charge with a customer
        'currency' => 'USD', // specifies the billing currency
        'lineItems' => array( // a list of line items included in this charge
            array(
                'description' => 'T-Shirt',
                'netAmount' => 10, // denominated in the currency specified above
                'quantity' => 1
            )
        ),
        'discountItems' => array( // an optional list of discounts
            array(
                'description' => 'Loyalty Discount',
                'netAmount' => '0.5'
            )
        ),
        'shippingCostItems' => array( // any shipping costs?
            array(
                'description' => 'Shipping and Handling',
                'netAmount' => '3.99',
                'taxable' => false // sometimes shipping costs are taxable
            )
        ),
        'taxItems' => array( // any taxes?
            array(
                'name' => 'CA Sales Tax',
                'percent' => '0.0825' // 8.25% CA sales tax
            )
        )
    ),
    'settlementCurrency' => 'EUR' // specifies in which currency you want to settle 
));

if ($response->httpStatusCode == 200) {   
    $data = json_decode($response->responseBody, true);
    $checkoutId = $data['checkoutId']; // store this persistently in your database
    $url = $data['url']; // redirect your customer to this URL to complete the payment
}
```

**Monitor Payment State** (https://www.coinqvest.com/en/api-docs#get-checkout)

Once the payment is captured we notify you via email, [webhook](https://www.coinqvest.com/en/api-docs#webhook-concepts). You can also poll [GET /checkout](https://www.coinqvest.com/en/api-docs#get-checkout) for payment status updates:

```php
$response = $client->get('/checkout', array('id' => $checkoutId));

if ($response->httpStatusCode == 200) {   
    $data = json_decode($response->responseBody, true);
    $state = $data['checkout']['state'];
    if (in_array($state, array('COMPLETED', 'DELAYED_COMPLETED', 'RESOLVED'))) {
        echo "The payment has completed and your account was credited. You can now ship the goods."
    } else {
        // try again in 30 seconds or so...
    }
}
```

**Query your USD Wallet** (https://www.coinqvest.com/en/api-docs#get-wallet)

    'sourceAmount' => '100',
    'targetNetwork' => 'NGN', // send to an NGN bank account
    'targetAccount' => array(
